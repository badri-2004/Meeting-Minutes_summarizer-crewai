## About `crews/`

The `crews/` folder contains modular CrewAI configurations, where each Crew is a mini team made of specialized Agents.

### 1. `meeting_minutes_crew/`

Handles **meeting processing** tasks with 2 main agents:

| Agent Name                  | Responsibility |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| `meeting_minutes_summarizer` | Summarizes the transcript, extracts action items, and performs sentiment analysis. |
| `meeting_minutes_writer`     | Writes the final meeting minutes by combining summary, action items, and sentiment. |

Flow inside the crew:
- First summarize the entire transcript.
- Then extract key action points.
- Then detect the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- Finally write a polished meeting report.

### 2. `gmail_crew/`

Handles **email delivery**:

| Agent Name | Responsibility |
|------------|-----------------|
| `emailer`  | Formats and sends the final meeting minutes to the configured email address. |

## Full Execution Flow (Behind the Scenes)

When you run `main.py`, the following happens:

1. **Audio Transcription**
    - Reads `meeting.wav`.
    - Splits into 60-second chunks.
    - Each chunk is sent to Google Gemini for transcription.
    - Chunks are combined to form the full meeting transcript.

2. **Meeting Minutes Summarization**
    - The transcript is fed to the `meeting_minutes_summarizer`.
    - Generates:
      - A short **summary**.
      - List of **action items**.
      - **Sentiment analysis** result.
    - Each output is saved to a file.

3. **Meeting Minutes Writing**
    - The `meeting_minutes_writer` reads the generated files.
    - Combines them into a **single polished meeting report**.
    - Report saved in `report.md`.

4. **Emailing the Report**
    - `emailer` agent picks up the report.
    - Formats it nicely.
    - Sends it via email automatically.
